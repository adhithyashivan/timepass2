Okay, this is a common integration pattern. SQL Server triggers themselves don't directly "emit" events that a standard Python script can "listen" to in real-time over a network without an intermediary.

Here's how we can structure a solution where the SQL trigger logs changes, and then Power Automate (using Python as a helper) reacts to those logged changes:

**The Overall Flow:**

1.  **SQL Server Trigger:** When data in `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE` changes, the trigger writes a detailed record into an `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog` table.
2.  **Power Automate - Trigger:** A Power Automate flow will be set up to periodically check the `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog` table for new entries. This is a polling mechanism.
3.  **Power Automate - Get Data:** The flow retrieves the new audit log entries.
4.  **Power Automate - Run Python Script:** For each new audit entry, the flow passes the data to a Python script action.
5.  **Python Script:** The Python script takes the audit data, formats a nice email message.
6.  **Power Automate - Send Email:** The flow takes the output from the Python script and sends an email.

Let's break it down:

---

**Part 1: SQL Server Setup (Tables and Trigger)**

This part is similar to what we discussed before, ensuring we have a good audit log.

**1. `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE` Table (Your existing table):**

```sql
CREATE TABLE AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE(
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Question VARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    Answer VARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL
);
GO
```

**2. `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog` Table:**

This table will capture the changes. We'll add a flag to easily identify processed records.

```sql
CREATE TABLE AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog (
    AuditLogID INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    QuestionaireID INT,
    OldQuestion VARCHAR(MAX),
    NewQuestion VARCHAR(MAX),
    OldAnswer VARCHAR(MAX),
    NewAnswer VARCHAR(MAX),
    ActionTaken VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
    ActionTimestamp DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    ActionUser VARCHAR(128) DEFAULT SUSER_SNAME(),
    IsNotified BIT DEFAULT 0 -- Flag to indicate if Power Automate has processed this
);
GO
```
*Added `IsNotified BIT DEFAULT 0`.*

**3. `TR_AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_Audit` Trigger:**

This trigger populates the audit log.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER TR_AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_Audit
ON AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE
AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
BEGIN
    IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0
        RETURN;

    SET NOCOUNT ON;

    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM inserted) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM deleted)
    BEGIN -- INSERT
        INSERT INTO AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog (
            QuestionaireID, NewQuestion, NewAnswer, ActionTaken
        )
        SELECT i.ID, i.Question, i.Answer, 'INSERT'
        FROM inserted i;
    END
    ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM deleted) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM inserted)
    BEGIN -- DELETE
        INSERT INTO AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog (
            QuestionaireID, OldQuestion, OldAnswer, ActionTaken
        )
        SELECT d.ID, d.Question, d.Answer, 'DELETE'
        FROM deleted d;
    END
    ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM inserted) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM deleted)
    BEGIN -- UPDATE
        INSERT INTO AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog (
            QuestionaireID, OldQuestion, NewQuestion, OldAnswer, NewAnswer, ActionTaken
        )
        SELECT
            i.ID,
            d.Question, i.Question,
            d.Answer, i.Answer,
            'UPDATE'
        FROM inserted i
        INNER JOIN deleted d ON i.ID = d.ID
        -- Optional: Only log if actual values changed for VARCHAR(MAX)
        -- WHERE ISNULL(d.Question, '') <> ISNULL(i.Question, '') OR ISNULL(d.Answer, '') <> ISNULL(i.Answer, '');
        ;
    END
END;
GO
```

**Part 2: Python Script (for Power Automate)**

This Python script will be executed by a Power Automate action. Power Automate will pass data to it, and the script will return a formatted string for the email.

**`format_audit_email.py` (Example Content):**

```python
import json
import pandas as pd # Power Automate's Python action often provides pandas

def format_email_body(audit_data_json_string):
    """
    Formats an email body based on the audit log data.
    audit_data_json_string: A JSON string representing a single audit log entry.
                            Power Automate will typically pass this.
    """
    try:
        # Power Automate might pass a list of dicts if you query multiple rows,
        # or a single dict if you iterate.
        # For this example, assume it's a JSON string of a single audit entry.
        audit_entry = json.loads(audit_data_json_string)

        action = audit_entry.get("ActionTaken", "N/A")
        q_id = audit_entry.get("QuestionaireID", "N/A")
        timestamp = audit_entry.get("ActionTimestamp", "N/A")
        user = audit_entry.get("ActionUser", "N/A")

        body = f"""
        <html><body>
        <h2>Agent Questionnaire Change Notification</h2>
        <p>An action occurred on the Agent Questionnaire table:</p>

            <li><strong>User:</strong> {user}</li>
        </ul>
        """

        if action == "INSERT":
            body += "<h3>New Entry Details:</h3>"
            body += f"<p><strong>Question:</strong> {audit_entry.get('NewQuestion', '')}</p>"
            body += f"<p><strong>Answer:</strong> {audit_entry.get('NewAnswer', '')}</p>"
        elif action == "DELETE":
            body += "<h3>Deleted Entry Details:</h3>"
            body += f"<p><strong>Question:</strong> {audit_entry.get('OldQuestion', '')}</p>"
            body += f"<p><strong>Answer:</strong> {audit_entry.get('OldAnswer', '')}</p>"
        elif action == "UPDATE":
            body += "<h3>Updated Entry Details:</h3>"
            body += "<h4>Before Change:</h4>"
            body += f"<p><strong>Old Question:</strong> {audit_entry.get('OldQuestion', '')}</p>"
            body += f"<p><strong>Old Answer:</strong> {audit_entry.get('OldAnswer', '')}</p>"
            body += "<h4>After Change:</h4>"
            body += f"<p><strong>New Question:</strong> {audit_entry.get('NewQuestion', '')}</p>"
            body += f"<p><strong>New Answer:</strong> {audit_entry.get('NewAnswer', '')}</p>"

        body += "<p>--- End of Notification ---</p>"
        body += "</body></html>"
        return body

    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error formatting email: {str(e)}\nData received: {audit_data_json_string}"

# --- How Power Automate will typically interact with this script ---
# Power Automate's "Run Python script" action might pass data via pandas DataFrame
# or expect you to read from a predefined input variable.
# For simplicity, this example assumes Power Automate can pass a JSON string
# as an argument to a function.
#
# If using the pandas DataFrame input method in Power Automate:
#
# import pandas as pd
# def main(dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame: # Or -> str if returning a single string
#     results = []
#     for index, row in dataframe.iterrows():
#         # Convert row to dict, then to JSON string for the existing function
#         audit_entry_json = row.to_json()
#         email_content = format_email_body(audit_entry_json)
#         results.append(email_content) # Or directly format here
#     # Return a DataFrame or a single string if appropriate
#     return pd.DataFrame(results, columns=['email_body'])
#
# # The actual call from Power Automate's perspective would be handled by its runtime.
# # You'd select this script and it would call the 'main' function by default if using
# # the pandas input/output. If passing a simple string, it might just execute the script
# # and you'd need to get the input from a specific variable provided by Power Automate.
```

**Important Notes for Python in Power Automate:**

*   **Environment:** The "Run Python script" action in Power Automate has specific requirements.
    *   If your SQL Server is on-premises, you'll likely need an **On-premises Data Gateway** installed on a machine that also has Python and any required libraries (like `pandas`) installed.
    *   If your SQL Server is Azure SQL Database, you might still need the gateway for the Python script execution if Power Automate doesn't yet have a fully cloud-hosted Python environment that meets your needs.
*   **Input/Output:** Power Automate typically passes data to the Python script as a pandas DataFrame and expects a pandas DataFrame back, or it might allow simple string inputs/outputs. The script above is written more generically to handle a JSON string, which is a common way to pass structured data. You'll need to adapt the input mechanism based on how the Power Automate action is configured.
*   **Simplicity:** For just formatting an email, you *could* do string formatting directly in Power Automate expressions, but Python offers more power if the logic gets complex.

**Part 3: Power Automate Flow Setup**

1.  **Create a new Flow:**
    *   Go to Power Automate ([flow.microsoft.com](http://flow.microsoft.com)).
    *   Click "Create" > "Scheduled cloud flow."
    *   **Flow name:** E.g., "SQL Audit Email Notifier for Agent Questionnaire"
    *   **Starting:** Set a recurrence (e.g., Repeat every `5` `Minutes`).
    *   Click "Create."

2.  **Step 1: Get unprocessed audit items from SQL Server:**
    *   Click "+ New step."
    *   Search for "SQL Server" and select "Get rows (V2)".
    *   **Connection:** Create or select your connection to the SQL Server. If on-premises, ensure your gateway is selected and working.
    *   **Server name:** Your SQL Server instance.
    *   **Database name:** Your database.
    *   **Table name:** Select `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog`.
    *   **Advanced options:**
        *   **Filter Query:** `IsNotified eq 0` (OData filter syntax to get rows where `IsNotified` is false/0).
        *   **Top Count:** Set a reasonable limit (e.g., `10` or `20`) to process in batches and avoid overwhelming the flow or email system.

3.  **Step 2: Loop through each unprocessed item (Apply to each):**
    *   Click "+ New step."
    *   Search for "Control" and select "Apply to each."
    *   **Select an output from previous steps:** Click in the field and select `value` from the "Get rows (V2)" dynamic content. This `value` is the list of rows.

4.  **Inside "Apply to each" - Step 3: Run Python script (Example - adapt as needed):**
    *   Click "Add an action" (inside the Apply to each loop).
    *   Search for "Python" and select "Run Python script" (this action might have specific prerequisites like the gateway).
        *   *If this action isn't available or suitable, an alternative is to call an Azure Function (where you deploy your Python code) via an HTTP request.*
    *   **Script:** Paste the content of your `format_audit_email.py` script here OR provide a path if the action supports it.
    *   **Input Dataset / Input Parameters:** This is where you pass the current audit log item to the script.
        *   You'll likely need to pass the dynamic content fields from the "Get rows (V2)" step that correspond to the current item in the loop (e.g., `ActionTaken`, `NewQuestion`, etc.).
        *   You might need to construct a JSON object/string using Power Automate expressions to pass to the Python script if it expects a single JSON string as in the `format_email_body` function.
            Example expression to create a JSON string for the current item:
            ```json
            json(item())
            ```
            You would pass this to an input parameter of the Python script action that your Python code then reads.
            Let's assume your Python action has an input field named `audit_data_json` and you put `json(item())` there.
            Your Python script would then need to be adjusted slightly to accept this parameter name.

            A more robust Python script for Power Automate's "Run Python script" action if it passes a DataFrame as input variable `dataFrame`:
            ```python
            # In format_audit_email.py
            import pandas as pd
            import json # Keep for the original function

            # Keep your original format_email_body function as is

            # This 'main' function is what Power Automate's "Run Python script"
            # action would typically execute if it passes a DataFrame
            def main(dataFrameFromPowerAutomate: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
                email_bodies = []
                for index, row in dataFrameFromPowerAutomate.iterrows():
                    # Convert the pandas Series (row) to a dictionary, then to JSON string
                    audit_entry_dict = row.to_dict()
                    audit_entry_json_string = json.dumps(audit_entry_dict)
                    email_body_html = format_email_body(audit_entry_json_string)
                    email_bodies.append(email_body_html)
                
                # Return a DataFrame with a column containing the email bodies
                return pd.DataFrame({'GeneratedEmailBody': email_bodies})
            ```
            In Power Automate, the output of this Python script action would then have a column `GeneratedEmailBody`.

5.  **Inside "Apply to each" - Step 4: Send an email:**
    *   Click "Add an action."
    *   Search for "Outlook" (or "SendGrid" if you prefer and have its connector set up) and select "Send an email (V2)" (Office 365 Outlook).
    *   **To:** Your desired recipient email address.
    *   **Subject:** E.g., `Questionnaire Change: @{items('Apply_to_each')?['ActionTaken']} on ID @{items('Apply_to_each')?['QuestionaireID']}`
        *   `items('Apply_to_each')?['ActionTaken']` gets the `ActionTaken` field of the current item in the loop.
    *   **Body:**
        *   Click in the body, then select "Expression."
        *   If your Python script returns the formatted HTML in a specific output field (e.g., from the `main` function returning a DataFrame, it might be `body('Run_Python_script')?['result']?[0]?['GeneratedEmailBody']` or similar, depending on how the Python action outputs data). You'll need to inspect the dynamic content available from the Python script action.
        *   **Important:** Make sure to click the `</>` (Code View) icon in the email body editor to switch to HTML mode if your Python script generates HTML.

6.  **Inside "Apply to each" - Step 5: Update the audit log item as notified:**
    *   Click "Add an action."
    *   Search for "SQL Server" and select "Update row (V2)".
    *   **Connection/Server/Database:** Same as in Step 1.
    *   **Table name:** `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE_AuditLog`.
    *   **Row id:** Select `AuditLogID` from the dynamic content of the current item in the "Apply to each" loop (`items('Apply_to_each')?['AuditLogID']`).
    *   **Show advanced options:**
        *   Find the `IsNotified` field and set its value to `true` (or `1`).

7.  **Save and Test your Flow:**
    *   Make some changes in your `AGENT_QUESTIONAIRE` SQL table.
    *   Manually run your Power Automate flow or wait for the schedule.
    *   Check the flow run history for successes or failures and debug as needed. Check the inputs/outputs of each step, especially the Python script action.

This provides a complete loop: SQL changes -> Audit Log -> Power Automate polls -> Python formats -> Power Automate emails -> Audit Log marked. This ensures you don't send duplicate emails for the same audit event.
